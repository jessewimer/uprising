create end of year function to copy all sales data from the OOinlcudes and SOIncludes
tables and populates the Sales table. This should be run once the website is turned off. 
this will be a command located at products/management/commands/aggregate_sales.py

import smarties varieties and stock seed data from the excel spreadsheet

import end of year sales data from shopify/wholesale

need to decide how to handle the transition time
in settings.py:
    -> FOR_YEAR -> this sets the for_year attribute when printing germ labels and creating new germ objects
                   it gets switch from one year to the next ~ July (when starting to )
    -> CURRENT_ORDER_YEAR
    -> TRANSITION = TRUE/FALSE



== wholesale finalize order ==
factor in store credit for pkts returned when finalizing an order
=============================

On the manage_products:
    create function to reset wholesale availability to FALSE    
    create function to reset website_bulk to FALSE
    add function to scan for items with no lineitem name

Add scoop icon on products page (next to envelope)

** Update usage calc **
if a product is retired, then check to see if an inventory for it was taken 
during the inventory window during the year in question (CURRENT_ORDER_YEAR-1). 
if inventory was taken, then calculate usage based on that inv. subtracted from the 
previous year's inv and do not report it as retired on the usage summary. If it was retired
during that sales year (aka no inv exists at the end of the sales year), use existing logic.
Further, if the transition flag is set to true use CURRENT_ORDER_YEAR-2 to get the last complete 
year of usage data
